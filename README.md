# Calculator Layout Boss Challenge

No knowledge is your own until you put it into practice. Using what you've learnt about auto layout, stack views and setting constraints, create the following UI.

This is a difficult challenge. You pass the challenge if you can create the vertical and horizontal stacks required for the layout. Once you've done that, you can also get extra credit if you figure out how to layout the small details.
